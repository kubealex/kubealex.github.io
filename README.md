## Welcome to my world!

I am Alessandro, a DevOps enthusiast deeply in love with Kubernetes and Openshift.

In my repositories, you will find stuff basically related to automation, CI/CD, Ansible, Golang stuff for studying and building awesome pieces of code.

### My main projects on GitHub

I actively maintain my two main projects:

[**libvirt-k8s-provisioner**](https://github.com/kubealex/libvirt-k8s-provisioner)

[**libvirt-ocp-provisioner**](https://github.com/kubealex/libvirt-ocp-provisioner)
